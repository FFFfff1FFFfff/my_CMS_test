Get Pre-Approved First</h2><p>Before you start browsing listings, get a mortgage pre-approval. This tells sellers you are a serious buyer and helps you understand your budget.</p><h2>2. Research the Neighborhood</h2><p>Look beyond the property itself. Consider commute times, school districts, local amenities, and future development plans in the area.</p><h2>3. Do Not Skip the Inspection</h2><p>A professional home inspection can reveal hidden issues that could cost thousands to repair. Always make your offer contingent on a satisfactory inspection.</p><h2>4. Think Long-Term</h2><p>Consider how your needs might change over the next 5-10 years. A home that works for you now should also accommodate future plans.</p><h2>5. Work with an Experienced Agent</h2><p>A knowledgeable real estate agent can negotiate on your behalf, identify potential issues, and guide you through the entire closing process.</p>',

Here are proven techniques you can implement yourself.</p><h2>Declutter and Depersonalize</h2><p>Remove personal photos, excess furniture, and clutter. Buyers need to envision themselves in the space, not see your life story.</p><h2>Focus on Curb Appeal</h2><p>First impressions matter. Fresh paint on the front door, well-maintained landscaping, and clean walkways set the tone for the entire showing.</p><h2>Let in Natural Light</h2><p>Open all curtains, clean windows, and add mirrors to reflect light. Bright spaces feel larger and more inviting.</p>',
