Document Everything</h2><p>Take photographs of the scene, vehicle damage, and any visible injuries. Collect contact information from all parties involved and any witnesses.</p><h2>2. Seek Medical Attention</h2><p>Even if you feel fine, see a doctor within 24 hours. Some injuries are not immediately apparent, and medical records are crucial evidence.</p><h2>3. Do Not Admit Fault</h2><p>Be careful about what you say at the scene and to insurance adjusters. Statements can be used against you later.</p><h2>4. Contact an Attorney</h2><p>An experienced personal injury attorney can help you navigate insurance claims, negotiate settlements, and protect your legal rights throughout the process.</p>',

They are particularly valuable if you have minor children, own property in multiple states, or have a blended family.</p><h2>Review Regularly</h2><p>Life changes — marriage, divorce, births, deaths, and significant financial changes — all warrant a review of your estate plan. We recommend reviewing your plan at least every three years.</p>',
